# noderestapi
A sandbox project to play with node.js REST API

The project is based on Scott Domes article [Build a Node.js API in Under 30 Minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2/#.eybmlr1g9)

Extra work from my side:
* Used TS
* Added typescript-eslint
* Added 404 checks
* Returned 500 status codes
